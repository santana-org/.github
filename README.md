# .github

Central repository for shared, organization-level configuration and standards.  
It helps keep all projects aligned, predictable, and easy to maintain.

## 📦 What’s inside

- **🧩 Community Health Files**  
  Default templates for issues, pull requests, contribution guidelines, and the code of conduct.  
  These are automatically applied to repositories that don’t define their own versions.

- **🏷️ Organization Profile**  
  The `profile/README.md` file powers the public organization profile on GitHub.  
  It serves as a short introduction for contributors and visitors, outlining who we are and how we work.
