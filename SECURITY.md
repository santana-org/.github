### 📣 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any repository of the organization,
please report it privately to  
**[alejandro.arancibia.aranda@gmail.com](mailto:alejandro.arancibia.aranda@gmail.com)**.

The inbox is not monitored 24/7, but all reports are reviewed as soon as possible.
If a vulnerability is confirmed, we’ll work on a fix and publish a patch based on
the impact and complexity of the issue.

Please avoid disclosing security issues publicly until they have been addressed.
We appreciate responsible reporting and clear technical details.
